# Power Automate Work Flow

**Model Used:** `deepseek-r1:latest`

**Filename:** `flow-two-weeks`

**Prompt:**

```
Build me a power automate flow that reads emails from outlook and responds with "Two more weeks".
```

**Reasoning:**

```
Okay, I need to help the user create a Power Automate flow that reads emails from Outlook and sends a response of "Two more weeks". Let me think through how to approach this.

First, I know that Power Automate flows are built using triggers, actions, and snippets. So, the flow will probably start with an email trigger because we want it to happen when someone in Outlook sends an email.

The user wants the flow to respond with a message, so after detecting the email, the next step should be an action like Send Email or Chat Message. Since the response is just text, Send Email seems appropriate as it's straightforward and can send messages directly.

I'll need to connect Power Automate to Outlook. I remember that you have to enable the Microsoft 365 apps integration in Power Automate for this to work. Otherwise, it won't recognize Outlook emails.

Let me outline the steps:
1. Use an Email Trigger to detect incoming emails.
2. Connect to Outlook using the Microsoft 365 apps integration.
3. Extract necessary information from the email, maybe just the sender's name and the email subject.
4. Use a Send Email action to reply with "Two more weeks" as the body.
5. Maybe set up conditions so that this response is sent only if certain criteria are met, but since the user didn't specify, I'll assume it's a general flow.

I should also consider whether the email has a subject that matches the message the user wants to send. So, in the action, I might need to check if the subject contains "Weeks" or something similar before sending.

Wait, how do I handle different languages? The user didn't specify, so perhaps it's safe to assume English is used since it's common for such flows.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the flow with these steps: trigger, connect Outlook, extract info (though maybe not necessary if just replying), and send email. Since extracting isn't needed here, I can skip that part or note that it might be optional based on specific needs.

I think the code will involve setting up triggers, actions, connecting to Outlook apps, and using conditions in the action. Also, I need to make sure the flow runs automatically once an email is detected.
